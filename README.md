# Description

A crude mouse mover applet that will move your mouse cursor to a random position on your screen if Windows detects no mouse movement in 5 minutes.

Yes, it's crude. I rarely write anything for Windows, and this is my first program done in Vis Studio proper, so plese forgive what I cann "printf debugging". I usually write *nix programs, and specialize in Embedded Systems, not PC programs. I just wrote this real quick for a friend so she can get her manager off her back.

I'm actually kinda proud of this. I banged it out in about 2 hours after work, not including documenting and adding repos and such. This included figuring out the basics for Visual Studio (I usually use VSCode)...

I've included **ALL** of the files from the VS Project for anyone that may want to pren this and play with it.

## Install/Run Instructions

1. Copy the .exe file from the `Releases` section at the right (current version 1.0.0) to your computer.
2. Run the file. NOTE: If Windows gripes about it being _dangerous_ or something, don't worry, there's nothing malicious about this. Windows is protective, and for good reason, as there are a LOT of nefarious folks out there,

## Notes
* The program will run in a blank command window. You can just minimize it while it's running, and can close it at any time whenever you don't want your mouse to be moved automatically. This way it's easy to disable it when you want to watch a video full-screen without the controls poppung up every couple minutes
