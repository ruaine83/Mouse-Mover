# Description

A crude mouse mover applet that will move your mouse cursor to a random position on your screen if Windows detects no mouse movement in 5 minutes.

Yes, it's crude. I rarely write anything for Windows, and this is my first program done in Vis Studio proper. I usually write *nix programs, and specialize in Embedded Systems, not PC programs. I just wrote this real quick for a friend so she can get her manager off her back.

I'm actually kinda proud of this. I banged it out in about 2 hours, not including documenting and adding repos and such.

## Install/Run Instructions

1. Copy the .exe file from the `Release Files` to your computer.
2. Run the file. NOTE: If Windows gripes about it being _dangerous_ or something, don't worry, there's nothing malicious about this.

__OR__ (if for some reason Windows doesn't want to download the .exe directly)

1. Copy the .zip file to your computer
2. Right-Click on it and extract the files
3. Run the program

## Notes
* The program will run in a blank command window. You can just minimize it while it's running, and can close it at any time whenever you don't want your mouse to be moved automatically.
